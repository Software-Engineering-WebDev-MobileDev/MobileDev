# MobileDev

## Setup

First, ensure flutter and proper sdks are installed on your machine. [Install_Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

Create a file titled .env within the bakery_manager_mobile folder (same directory level as pubspec.yaml and .env.example). In this file copy the contents of the .env.example file into .env. Change the {backend_ip_address} to the ip address of the backend. 

Then within vscode ensure the proper development target is selected at the bottom right, target device should be an android, and select start debugging from within main.dart.
